# Replication of Batch Normalization

In this repository, some of the results of the original Batch Normalization[1] [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167.pdf) is replicated in PyTorch.

See [ReplicationOfBatchNormalization.ipynb](./ReplicationOfBatchNormalization.ipynb) file for codes and details.
